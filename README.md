# Year 3 Aerospace Anki Cards
Flashcards repository for 3rd-year BSC TU Delft Aerospace classes. These flashcards are meant to help solidify the learned content in your memory (specially helpful for Production), and are meant to be used only **after** all the content has been read/understood. All the material is taken from the Sammaries - credits to Sam van Elsloo. Hopefully this will help you pass your exams this year, and be sure to leave feedback on any mistakes/improvements for the cards.

Installation/use instructions:

1. Get Anki at https://apps.ankiweb.net/.
2. Install the CrowdAnki plugin at https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778.
3. Clone this repo to a directory.
4. Import the decks from the repo using CrowdAnki "import from disk" (select the folder that has a deck.json file in it - do this for each deck).
5. Get practicing!
